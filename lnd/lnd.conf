; ZMQ socket which sends rawblock and rawtx notifications from bitcoind. By
; default, lnd will attempt to automatically obtain this information, so this
; likely won't need to be set (other than for a remote bitcoind instance).

; Path to write the admin macaroon for lnd's RPC and REST services if it
; doesn't exist. This can be set if one wishes to store the admin macaroon in a
; distinct location. By default, it is stored within lnd's network directory.
; Applications that are able to read this file, gain admin macaroon access.
; adminmacaroonpath=~/.lnd/admin.macaroon

; Path to write the read-only macaroon for lnd's RPC and REST services if it
; doesn't exist. This can be set if one wishes to store the read-only macaroon
; in a distinct location. The read only macaroon allows users which can read
; the file to access RPCs which don't modify the state of the daemon. By
; default, it is stored within lnd's network directory.
; readonlymacaroonpath=~/.lnd/readonly.macaroon

; Path to write the invoice macaroon for lnd's RPC and REST services if it
; doesn't exist. This can be set if one wishes to store the invoice macaroon in
; a distinct location. By default, it is stored within lnd's network directory.
; The invoice macaroon allows users which can read the file to gain read and
; write access to all invoice related RPCs.
; invoicemacaroonpath=~/.lnd/invoice.macaroon




[Ltcd]

; The host that your local ltcd daemon is listening on. By default, this
; setting is assumed to be localhost with the default port for the current
; network.
; ltcd.rpchost=localhost

; Username for RPC connections to ltcd. By default, lnd will attempt to
; automatically obtain the credentials, so this likely won't need to be set
; (other than for simnet mode).
; ltcd.rpcuser=kek

; Password for RPC connections to ltcd. By default, lnd will attempt to
; automatically obtain the credentials, so this likely won't need to be set
; (other than for simnet mode).
; ltcd.rpcpass=kek

; File containing the daemon's certificate file. This only needs to be set if
; the node isn't on the same host as lnd.
; ltcd.rpccert=~/.ltcd/rpc.cert

; The raw bytes of the daemon's PEM-encoded certificate chain which will be used
; to authenticate the RPC connection. This only needs to be set if the ltcd
; node is on a remote host.
; ltcd.rawrpccert=


[tor]
; The port that Tor's exposed SOCKS5 proxy is listening on. Using Tor allows
; outbound-only connections (listening will be disabled) -- NOTE port must be
; between 1024 and 65535
; tor.socks=9050

; The DNS server as IP:PORT that Tor will use for SRV queries - NOTE must have
; TCP resolution enabled. The current active DNS server for Testnet listening is
; nodes.lightning.directory
; tor.dns=nodes.lightning.directory

; Enable Tor stream isolation by randomizing user credentials for each
; connection. With this mode active, each connection will use a new circuit.
; This means that multiple applications (other than lnd) using Tor won't be mixed
; in with lnd's traffic.
; tor.streamisolation=1



[autopilot]
; If the autopilot agent should be active or not. The autopilot agent will
; attempt to automatically open up channels to put your node in an advantageous
; position within the network graph.
; autopilot.active=1

; The maximum number of channels that should be created.
; autopilot.maxchannels=5

; The fraction of total funds that should be committed to automatic channel
; establishment. For example 0.6 means that 60% of the total funds available
; within the wallet should be used to automatically establish channels. The total
; amount of attempted channels will still respect the maxchannels param.
; autopilot.allocation=0.6
